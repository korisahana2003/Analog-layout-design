# ⚡ **Key VLSI Terminology**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **IR Drop** | Voltage drop due to metal resistance |
| **Offset** | Unwanted difference between differential pair outputs |
| **Mismatch** | Device variations due to process gradients & random effects |
| **Ground Bounce** | Noise caused by fast switching currents |
| **WPE** | Well Proximity Effect (changes near well edge) |
| **AGND** | Clean ground for analog paths |
| **End-cap effect** | Poly/diffusion distortion at edges |

---

# 🛠️ **Tools Used**
- Cadence Virtuoso  
- Mentor Calibre  
- KLayout  
- Python (scripts)  
- GitHub for documentation  

---

# 📘 **Layout Checklist**
✔ Same orientation  
✔ Same diffusion edges  
✔ Same contact count  
✔ Balanced routing  
✔ Guard ring symmetry  
✔ Poly end-caps  
✔ Density uniformity  
✔ Dummy devices added
